              Kottayam
          </h2>
          <p>
            Kottayam is blessed with nature’s bounty in abundance. It is the pride of God’s own country with its beautiful churches, charming nearby hill stations, significant temples, and refreshing waterfalls. The Western Ghats and the backwaters add to the beauty to this undisturbed, rustic town of Kerala. The numerous plantations – rubber, coconut, palm, spices and the flora make for lush green landscapes that are totally stunning. All these factors, aside from it being strikingly beautiful, make it as one of the must visit destinations in Kerala.
            Though a handful, the tourist places in Kottayam guarantee a peaceful retreat. It is not one of most famous towns of Kerala, but is no less beautiful than the likes of Munnar, Alleppey or Kanyakumari. If you gotta see it to believe it, here’s a round up of quaint and charming places to visit in and around Kottayam.
