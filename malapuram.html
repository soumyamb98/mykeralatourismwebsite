          Malapuram
        </h2>
        
        
        <p>Malappuram is a northern district in Kerala known for its rich culture, historic significance and remarkable heritage. The region of Malappuram, speckled with small hills and mounds, justifies its name which in Malayalam means ‘Hill Top’. With a history that weaves ancient and modern times together, the region contributed extensively to the culture, religion, economy as well as tourism of Kerala. The district invited the attention of economists from all over the country in recent times due to its Gulf migrant population which gave rise to an unprecedented economic boom. Three rivers, namely Chaliyar, Bharathapuzha and Kadalundi, flow through the land of Malappuram enriching both its soil and its culture. The powerful army of the Zamorins kings of Calicut was headquartered here in the olden days. The name of the district is marked in the history of Indian nationalism for being the venue for Khilafat Movement and Mopila Revolt
