Besides, it also takes pride in being the abode of the second largest arch dam in the world. Being a part of Chera Dynasty and the home of many early European settlers, Idukki has grabbed a place in the history. It has been an important business hub for many ages as teak, rosewood, sandalwood, ivory and peacock etc are said to be exported from here to many far-off countries. Idukki bears testimony of a stone-age civilization, though many historians believe Paleolithic men inhabited here. Remnants of Menhir and Tombs belonging to stone-age were excavated in 1947-48 near Udumbanchola and Peermede. Contrived as a district on 26 January 1972, the district of Idukki, second largest in Kerala, comprises of many important towns such as Devikulam, Adimali, Udumbanchola, Thekkady, Murrikkaddy, Peermede and Thodapuzha. Idukki also bears rivers such as Thodupuzhayar, Periyar and Thalaya. It also beds thirteen peaks, other than Anamudi that have an altitude of above 2000 m. Idukki can be called the Power House of Kerala as it caters to 66% of the state’s Hydroelectric Power/</p>
