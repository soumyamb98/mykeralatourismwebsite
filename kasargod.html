        <h2>Kasargod</h2>
        <p>Kasargode, the northernmost district of Kerala is of historical and archaeological interest to many. It is said that the Arabs came through Kasargode to Kerala in the 9th and 14th centuries. The Bekal Fort is the most treasured monument in Kasargode as it runs directly into the sea with a bay towards the south. The name is derived from a combination of two words, ‘kasaara’ which means lake in Sanskrit and 'kroda' which means a secured place for treasure. Kasargode essentially is enveloped by the Kaasaraka trees and the origin of the name can be also attributed to these trees. There are also other varieties of tress typical to the coastline grown here. The landscape of Kasargode is characterized by the typical coconut and palm trees and streams which flow through the hills into the sea. Houses with sloping roofs, topped with home baked tiles is a specialty of this town</p>
