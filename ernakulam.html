        <h2> Ernakulam </h2>
        <p>Popularly known as "The Queen of Arabian Sea," Ernakulam was a well-known center of spice trade among ancient Greeks, Romans, Jews, Arabs, and Chinese. It is the first district in the whole country to have 100 percent literacy by 1990. There are many other things that make this modern city one of the prime attractions in Kerala, like beautiful coastlines, fringed with coconut and palm trees, backwaters, that leads to peaceful and sleepy villages of Kerala, and enormous natural beauty.

          On a vacation in Ernakulam, one can visit the famous River Periyar, that flows through almost all the districts of Kerala. This river is one of the longest rivers in the state and is surrounded by a rich plantation of coconut and palm trees. It also has many man-made islands that are worth visiting. These islands are small in size but are loaded with abundant natural beauty, that comprises lush green trees and exotic wildlife.With the Arabian Sea on one side and the flourishing cities like Thrissur, Alappuzha, and Kottayam on the other, Eranakulam enjoys a position of being the most commercially rich cities of Kerala. The beautiful surroundings and easy connectivity to other parts of the country make Ernakulam one of the most popular tourism cities in Kerala. No doubt this place is known as the Commercial Capital of Kerala, all because it hosts the highest number of International and domestic tourists and is the major business hub of Kerala with the highest revenue yielding record in the state.

          Earlier known as Kochi, Ernakulam has always been the talk of the town for its development initiatives right from the beginning. It was formed by the two princely states of Travancore and Cochin and the British Malabar in 1958 by carving out regions from Thrissur and Kottayam and came to be recognized as the biggest natural port and center of trade on the West Coast. The name 'Ernakulam' is derived from the name of a very famous temple of Lord Shiva called the "Ernakulathappan Temple" whose actual meaning is 'Pond for a long time.
          
          Apart from the business traveling, one of the main purpose to visit Ernakulam is to see 'Chavittu Natakam.' A lot of foreign tourists love to watch this amazing dance form, and that's perhaps the reason why one can see so many dances, and music schools in every nook, and cranny. The Ernakulam city also has many beautiful churches and palaces, that reflects the Portuguese culture and their way of life. The most important religious communities of the district are Hindus, Christians, and Muslims. Other communities that form the part of the cosmopolitan population are the Buddhists, the Jains, the Sikhs, and the Jews.
          
          There is so much to see and explore in Ernakulam, it has various historical sites, temples, forts, beaches, museums, and other tourist places to attract travelers from all around the world. No doubt that Ernakulam is an ultimate destination for a globetrotter, who aims to explore as much as they can in their single visit to 'God's Own Country.</p>

                This was at that time the Governor’s palace for the commander of the Dutch Malabar. In the year 1909 it was leased out to the British, hence serving as the home of the British Governors. It was also the seat of the British Resident of Cochin during the British Raj.
                
                Later on in the year 1947, when India attained independence from the British, the palace became the state’s property and then later was converted into a heritage hotel resort. Now this palace has a swimming pool along with a 9 hole golf course and an ayurvedic centre.
